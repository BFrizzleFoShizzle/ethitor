Ethitor is (or will be :I) a C-based plugin extendable man-in-the-middle Ethernet packet modification platform for Linux.
The idea is to run it on a device with two ethernet ports, with the connection you want to modify running through the device.
I'm running it on a Banana Pi, using a USB to Ethernet adapter for the second port. You could run it on a Raspberry Pi or something similar if you wanted.
